# ModellingAndSimulation
Zoe and Daniella, Autumn 2025

Wolfram files used to compute models for: Modelling the growth of Digital brainrot!

Structure:
1 SIR.nb -> Base model
2 SIRS.nb -> Adding relapse and exponential behaviour for infection
3 SEIRS.nb -> Adding an exposed player, damping the system
4 SIRCS.nb -> initial 2 models to simulate a self recovery approach based on societal behaviour and media cycles
4.1 SIRCS.nb -> Final worked model simulating Panic response recovery shown in report
